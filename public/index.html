                <p>
                    The Shazam-like feature allows you to play any music around you, and our app will listen to the sound, analyze it, and identify the song for you. 
                    With just a tap on the "Shazam" button, the app will start recognizing the music playing in your environment and will display the song title, 
                    artist, and album (if available). This feature is extremely useful when you hear a song on the radio, in a café, or anywhere else, and you can’t quite figure out its name or artist.
                </p>

                <h2>Searching Songs Based on Your Input</h2>
                <p>
                    If you already know the name of the song or the artist, you can quickly search for it by typing keywords into the search bar above. 
                    The app will provide a list of songs, albums, and artists that match your query. Whether you want to find a specific track or explore 
                    music from your favorite artists, the search bar is a quick way to navigate through the music database and find the exact content you're looking for. 
                    Suggestions will be provided as you type, making the process seamless and fast. This is perfect for discovering new music based on your preferences or finding that specific song you love.
